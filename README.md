## Project Overview
The Salesforce Tours & Travels Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Platform is a customized solution developed to support the core operations of a travel and tours business using Salesforce’s powerful CRM tools. This system is designed to help manage client inquiries, tour package selections, bookings, payments, and post-travel feedback all within a centralized platform. By automating routine tasks such as booking approvals, customer updates, and task reminders through tools like Flows and Process Builders, the platform improves efficiency and accuracy. It also improves the customer experience by delivering tailored communication and ensuring safe management of data, while supporting the business with real-time insights through interactive reports and dashboards. This project aims to deliver a reliable, scalable system that empowers travel agencies to serve clients more effectively and grow their operations with ease.

## Phase 1: Requirement Analysis & Planning

During the Requirement Analysis & Planning phase of my Tours and Travels CRM project, I focused on gaining a deep understanding of the travel domain, its business processes, and user expectations. I gathered and analyzed system requirements to define what the platform needed to deliver for both travel agents and customers. From this analysis, I was able to outline a clear project scope and build a technical roadmap that served as the foundation for the entire development process. This early planning ensured that the CRM would be scalable, well-structured, and aligned with real-world travel operations, setting the stage for efficient implementation and future growth.

### Understanding Business Requirements

I began by analyzing how global tours and travel agencies operate, focusing on challenges like manual bookings, poor communication, and limited tracking. By gathering input from stakeholders and studying relevant resources, I identified key requirements such as automating workflows, managing bookings by region, and improving customer engagement through feedback and reporting.

### Defining Project Scope & Objectives

The goal was to build a scalable, role-based CRM that supports the entire booking lifecycle—from inquiry to feedback. My objectives were to reduce manual work, streamline operations, enhance customer experience through automation, and provide actionable insights via reports and dashboards.

### Gathering & Analyzing User Needs

I collected user needs from key roles like customers, agents, guides, finance, and admins. Tools like Google Forms, user personas, and journey mapping helped me understand expectations like simple onboarding, personalized booking options, and dynamic pricing based on membership tiers.

### Identifying Key Salesforce Features & Tools Required

To meet business needs, I selected relevant Salesforce tools including custom objects, Flows, Apex classes, LWC components, and analytics features. I also designed automation processes and integrated approval workflows, ensuring flexibility, scalability, and a responsive UI.

### Designing Data Model and Security Model

I designed a relational data model linking customers, bookings, packages, payments, guests, and feedback. Security-wise, I implemented role hierarchies, custom profiles, field-level permissions, and sharing rules to ensure appropriate data access across different user types.

## Phase 2: Salesforce Development – Backend & Configurations

In this phase, I developed the core functionality of the Tours and Travels CRM by configuring standard Salesforce features and building custom backend logic. I used Flows and Process Builders to automate tasks like booking confirmations, feedback collection, and payment status updates. Where complex logic was needed—like bulk operations or real-time record creation—I implemented Apex triggers, batch jobs, and future methods. I also configured roles, profiles, permission sets, and sharing rules to secure data access based on user type. This backend setup ensured that the CRM operates smoothly, handles data efficiently, and supports scalable business processes.
